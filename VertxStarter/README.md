# Vertx starter

This demo application is used Vert.x v3.7.

If u wanna start this demo, u need to download or clone first. HAHA

Suppose you use IntelliJ IDEA as the IDE to launch the demo. \
U need to add new configuration that type is application at startup. \
And then edit the new configuration like this: 
> Add Name such as "Vertx app" \
> Add Main class must be "io.vertx.core.Launcher" \
> Add Program arguments must be "run 'MainVerticle Path'"

Or u can refer to the picture below:
![vertx start configuration](http://images.hallong13.cn/show/vertx%20start%20configuration.jpg)


Fine, Run "Vertx app" now

Can u see the message that is "Succeeded in deploying verticle"?

Yep, u got it and go to the browser and enter “http://localhost:8080” to verify it!
